# Qogir
Qogir (normal and hdpi) Fluxbox Theme that tries to match the nice [Qogir Gtk Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-theme). It includes a white variant too but for that you will need to use [custom build Fluxbox](https://github.com/pijulius/fluxbox) that supports that. It will use Xdamage to try and find the right theme variant to use but you can manually have it remembered too.

* For shadows, rounded corners and animations use my custom build of [picom](https://github.com/pijulius/picom).
